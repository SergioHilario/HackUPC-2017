## About us
We are a group of physicists and mathematicians that have a solid background in mathematical modelling. We started this HackUPC without previous knowledge on software development, java language or the plataform Android Studio. Despite this, our objective when we joined the HackUPC was to learn how to develop a mobile app.

# Project description: Android app "MemoHack"
## Motivation and objectives
Our objective (at long term), is to develop an app were you can build libraries with words or concepts, along with their corresponding definitions or any brief description. For exemple a biologist could build a library with a bunch of proteins, and their respective chemical composition.

What is new is that our app will help the users memorising or studying all the information accumulated in their libraries by periodically sending push notifications inquiring about some randomly chosen words previously saved in the library (and thus reinforcing the learning of those concepts). One of the major strengths of the implemented system is that it doesn't even require the user to open the application in order to submit the answer, since the application implements a direct reply system. 

Our idea, is that users could share their libraries in order to build a platform where people could help each other studying diverse areas of knowledge. For example a law student, could build a library with laws while studying for his/her exams, and use the app to memorize them, and then share its library to help other students. 

In the long run, the idea is to build an open platform where the app is integrated, providing every user with a fully personalised study support. This could be used in a wide number of knowledge fields: Vocabulary of a foreign language, proteins and its chemical composition or properties, physical laws, theorems, historical events, list of functions in a certain code language...

## Delivered demo
Of course, accomplishing all the objectives mentioned above in an only hackathon was beyond our possibilities. Instead, what we did is a proof of principle of how the app would work. Using Android Studio, we have developed an Android app where you can build your own library of words along with their corresponding definitions/translations. The app records this information, and periodically sends a push notification asking the user the definition/translation corresponding to one of the words saved in the library. Thus, the main function of this app is helping to remember those tricky words that we confuse or forget.

### Version 1
Test version of the MemoHack where notifications appear via a button click.
### Version 2
Final beta version of the MemoHack where notifications appear sporadically.

## Most straightforward further developments
* Punctuation/recompense system
* Library editing
* Configurable settings (frequency of the notifications, library choosing, etc)

# Acknowledgements and hackathon experience
We would like to thank the HackUPC organizers, sponsors and volunteers for this experience. We have learnt a lot from the hacking and coding world, as well as some java programming language and how to use the Android Studio environment. We enjoyed this experience a lot and we hope to repeat it in the future.

Thank you!
